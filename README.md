# Framework

## Overview
This project is a unity framework build on top of Unity6, designed to help developers build applications more efficiently. This  project is inspired from design patterns and game architecture using ScriptableObjects. Itâ€™s intended to be explored together with the e-book, [Create modular game architecture in Unity with ScriptableObjects](https://unity.com/resources/create-modular-game-architecture-with-scriptable-objects-ebook).

## Getting Started
Start the project from the BootScene scene in Assets/Core/Scene. There are two parts to the project:

- Core: 
The core part of the project includes essential functionalities and base classes that are used throughout the framework. It provides the foundational elements required to build and extend the application.
- Main:
The main part of the project demonstrates the practical application of the core functionalities.

## To do
- [x] Set up scene management (loading, transitions)
- [ ] Implement basic UI elements (menus, buttons, HUD)
- [ ] Integrate audio management (background music, sound effects)
- [ ] Develop save/load system (player progress, settings)
