# Framework

## Overview
This project is a unity framework build on top of Unity6, designed to help developers build applications more efficiently. This  project is inspired from design patterns and game architecture using ScriptableObjects. Itâ€™s intended to be explored together with the e-book, [Create modular game architecture in Unity with ScriptableObjects](https://unity.com/resources/create-modular-game-architecture-with-scriptable-objects-ebook).

## Getting Started
Start the project from the BootScene scene in Assets/Core/Scene. 

## File structure
This project's scripts are structured in a feature-based architecture. Each feature is a folder that contains all the scripts and assets related to that feature. The features are:

- Audio: Contains the audio manager, audio mixer.
- EventChannels: Contains the event channels and events.
- Game: Contains the game manager and game-related assets.
- Input: Contains the input manager and input control.
- SceneManagement: Contains the scene manager and scene loader.
- UI: Contains the UI manager and UXML.
- Utilities: Contains helper classes and structs that are used across the project.
    - SaveLoad: Contains the static save/load system.

For other assets, such as prefabs, ScriptableObject data, clips. They are stored in the Resources folder.

## To do
- [x] Set up scene management (loading, transitions)
- [ ] Implement basic UI elements (menus, buttons, HUD)
- [x] Integrate audio management (background music, sound effects)
- [x] Develop save/load system (player progress, settings)
- [ ] Create core gameplay mechanics (player movement, interactions)
- [x] Establish input management (keyboard, mouse, gamepad)
